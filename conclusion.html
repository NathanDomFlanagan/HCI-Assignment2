<h1><a id="conclusion">Conclusion </h1>

<p>The usability of a website is an important criterion for evaluating it from a user's perspective (Karami, F et al.,2016). The main purpose of this research is to measure the usability of AUT Canvas. A usability test measures how well a product can be used based on direct observations and conversations with potential users. </p>
<p>Based on the ethnographic study conducted, many concerns been observed by researchers and raised by participants in terms of the structure of website and ease of use. 85% of participants struggled and gave up with finding the lab space booking website through Canvas. Also noticed the difficulty in understanding the menu options and long steps needed to finish a particular task. 
  Even though, the percentage of overall satisfaction of using Canvas was high in terms of receiving updates about the course, announcements and contacting lectures and study resources especially participants who had experience with ‘blackboard’ (old system).</p>

<h3 class="title">Recommendations for Improvement </h3>

<p>In response to the problems identified, researchers developed general recommendations for improving the AUT Canvas' usability. </p>
<p>First category of recommendation is related to making easier to find the contents and resources along with instructions to show the usability of website. Too many steps need to be taken to reach a particular task or find resources. Some contents are apparently hidden under unexpected tabs, for instance, booking lab space website has been kept under a tab which is difficult for the end-users to find out. Simple and understandable features, navigation must me intuitive, and easy to use for everyone. Additionally, researchers recommend to incorporate a search function to find the items rapidly. </p>

<p>Second category of recommendation is making the dashboard more organised and tidier with essential information. Notification option need to be kept in a different tab which leads to separate page can avoid the jumble and consuming the whole screen space. </p>

<p>Third category of recommendation is to incorporate a chat room space for frequent and effortless communication with classmates for study purpose. This helps effective interaction between students and compel to use Canvas rather than other chat room apps. </p>

<p>Need 4th category</p>
