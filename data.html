    <h1>Scenario</h1>
    <p>We are looking at the difference between the time taken with a particular task and the self-reported difficultly of said task. </p>
    <h2>Task 1</h2> 

    <p>For task 1, we noticed that participants 1 and 6 took the longest amount of time but reported the task to be 4, not a difficult of 5. This is due to the participants giving up on the task and accidentally finding it as they were trying to complete the other tasks. Participant number 2 and 5 however, can be seen to have given up completely, with participant 2 rating the task a 5, and was not able to stumble upon it while doing the tasks.  Participant number 5 gave a rating of 1, he stumbled upon the inbox and realised how to complete the task but never tried doing it, but still gave it a 1 during the interview afterward.

    <h2>Task 2</h2>
    <p>Task 2 creating a to-do task on calendar shows that all participants were able to accomplish the task with speed and reported as not difficult except participant 1.

  <div class="task3">
    <h2>Task 3</h2>
  <p>In task 3 all participants reported the task difficultly to be lower than a 3 and with a much lower time completion.</p>

</div>
<div class="task4">
  <h2>Task 4</h2>
  <p>Only participant number 2 was able to accomplish the task, every other participant gave up. Participant number 1 spent the longest in trying to achieve the task, whereas the other participants that could not accomplish the task gave up after a few minutes. Participant number 2 said, “I think I saw it earlier” while he was doing his exploration of Canvas. Because he accidentally stumbled upon it during his exploration, he was able to quickly complete this task.</p>
