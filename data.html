    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Asking Participants difficulty of Task</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center ;">With a scale rating from 1 (Easy) to 5 (Difficult), the participants were asked to rate the task after completion of their test.</p>

        <div>
          <h5>How difficult was sending a message using Canvas?</h5>
          <p> The difficulty of the task is shown to be spread across the graph. The participants that were familiar with messaging a message before was able to do it with no problem where as particpants that has never done it before struggled.</p>

      <h5>How difficult was doing the to-do task for specific class?</h5>
      <p>A lot more participants find this task task easier than sending a message in Canvas.</p>

      <p>The graph is skewed to the left showing that the majority of participants find this easy.</p>

    <div>
      <h5>How difficult was using Canvas to book PC and Study Room?</h5>
      <p>Whereas the graph here is skewed to the right showing that the participants find this task very difficult. This suggests that the majority of participants have no idea about booking a PC and study through Canvas.</p>

    <p>Of course the majority of the participants said that the hardest task is booking a PC and study room. But the interesting thing is 16.7% of participants reported that sending a message through Canvas to be hard.</p>

  <p>We are looking at the difference between the time taken with a particular task and the self-reported difficultly of said task. </p>

          <h2>Task 1</h2> 
          <p>For task 1, we noticed that participants 1 and 6 took the longest amount of time but reported the task to be 4, not a difficult of 5. This is due to the participants giving up on the task and accidentally finding it as they were trying to complete the other tasks. Participant number 2 and 5 however, can be seen to have given up completely, with participant 2 rating the task a 5, and was not able to stumble upon it while doing the tasks.  Participant number 5 however, gave a rating of 1, he stumbled upon the inbox and realised how to complete the task but never tried doing it, but still gave it a 1 during the interview afterward.

          <p>In task 2 creating a to-do task on calendar shows that all participants were able to accomplish the task with speed and reported as not difficult except participant 1.

      <p>In task 3 all participants reported the task difficultly to be lower than a 3 and with a much lower time completion.</p>

      <h2>Task 4</h2>
      <p>Only participant number 2 was able to accomplish the task, every other participant gave up. Participant number 1 spent the longest in trying to achieve the task, whereas the other participants that could not accomplish the task gave up after a few minutes. Participant number 2 said, “I think I saw it earlier” while he was doing his exploration of Canvas. Because he accidentally stumbled upon it during his exploration, he was able to quickly complete this task.</p>

  <div class="dataConclusion">
    <h2>Question</h2>
    <h4>Does a a longer duration in completing a task equavilate to the task being difficult?</h4>
    <p>There is no statistical evidence that  difficulty and completion time are correlated (significant level is 0.05)</p>
