<p>The internet has become an essential infrastructure for us. Many people use mobile phones or pc to communicate with other people, work, and even take online lectures. Many schools and colleges adopt learning management systems that elevate the learning experience of students. AUT has been using Blackboard and replaced it with AUT Canvas recently. AUT Canvas is a web-based learning management system. Canvas provides many functionalities such as displaying the papers information that students are taking, submitting assignments, and checking schedules on a calendar. In this report, we conduct usability research on AUT Canvas. To begin with, we discuss what usability testing is and the methodology of usability testing. Secondly, we show the design of our usability research. Then, we present the collected data and our data analysis on it. Finally, we summarise our research and insights on the usability of AUT Canvas.</p>
