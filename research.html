  <h3>Explain about our Sample</h3>

  <p>Our participants are all AUT students spanning from various degrees. In total we have around 11 participants. This sample will provide insight into how they use Canvas for their degrees, as Canvas has only been used this year in 2022 for AUT students. The way our participants use the website should be similar, as some website depending on the class is done slightly differently but share the same main functions.  </p>

  <h3>How we conduct our usability testing</h3>

  <p>We will conduct our usability by first inviting them into a study room in the library so we can conduct this test with as little outside interaction as possible that could distract our users. We will give them the consent form to read and sign with their own will. Then inside this study room we have allocated our https://canvas.aut.ac.nz/accounts/1/external_tools/106?launch_type=global_navigation participants, we will give them a general instruction on using the websites features and functions, we will keep this consistent and narrow so that we have the same test for every participant, and so we can gather data and form our analysis from it. Keeping the instructions narrow also helps with having a consistent usability test so we can gather data on a certain area of Canvas' website. During their time conducting the usability test we will be recording them, with their consent for data collection. Once they have completed our general instructions, we will ask various questions about the difficulty of performing the task, if it was confusing and which task is the hardest.  </p>

 <!--<h3>instructions</h3>

  <p>We will give them the 4 following instructions: </p>

  <p> 1. Send a message to someone using Canvas </p>
    
  <p> Steps -> go to canvas -> inbox ->compose new message </p>
  
  <p> 2. Create a Todo task for a specific class, and view this Todo task </p>

  <p>Steps -> go to calendar -> create new to-do </p>

  <p> 3. Go to the library section and look for the APA7th referencing </p>

  <p>Steps -> Go to AUT library website -> Find the Referencing part in pages -> Find APA7th 		guides for referencing  </p>

  <p> 4. Using Canvas book a PC/ study room </p>

  <p>Steps -> Go to the Faculty home page -> University Support Services -> IT support services -> Booking a Computer Lab Space  </p> -->

  <h3>Usability Test Scenario </h3>
  <p>This usability test is to test out how easy it is to perform tasks an average University student at AUT would use. There will be several different tasks that are each unique and different. The scenario is performing simple tasks to being ready to make a written report with a group. </p>

  <p> 1. Send a message to Nathan Flanagan or Masaomi using Canvas in the Byzantine group </p>
  <p> 2. Create a to-do list task for the HCI class; and view it once it's made in the calendar  </p>
  <p> 3. Go to the library in Canvas and find the referencing section for APA 7th edition referencing </p>
  <p> 4. Using Canvas, find the lab space booking website  </p>
