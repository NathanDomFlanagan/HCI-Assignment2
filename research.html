  <h3 class="title">Explain about our Sample</h3>

  <p>Our participants are all AUT students spanning from various degrees. In total, we have 7 participants however, it turned out that the data from one of them could not be used because the exploration session was conducted differently compared to the other participants so we only used the remaining 6 participants. This sample will provide insight into how they use Canvas for their degrees, as Canvas has only been used this year in 2022 for AUT students. The way our participants use the website should be similar, as some website depending on the class is done slightly differently but share the same main functions.  </p>

  <h3 class="title">How we conduct our usability testing</h3>

  <p>We will conduct our usability by first inviting them into a study room in the library so we can conduct this test with as little outside interaction as possible that could distract our users. We will give them the consent form to read and sign with their own will. Then inside this study room we have allocated our participants, we will give them a general instruction on using the Canvsa websites features and functions, we will keep this consistent and narrow so that we have the same test for every participant, and so we can gather data and form our analysis from it. Keeping the instructions narrow also helps with having a consistent usability test so we can gather data on a certain area of Canvas' website. During their time conducting the usability test we will be recording them, with their consent for data collection. They will first browse Canvas contents to get a feel of the website as a whole for 5 minutes, then they will try to do our 4 given tasks in our made up scenario of trying to organise a meetup with friends to complete a report. During their process of looking aorund the website for 5 minutes and also trying to perform the tasks given we'll ask the participants if they can verbally explain what they are currently doing such as where they are in the website, and what their thoughts are such as if they are lost or confused on how to performt he task. These tasks wont be specific step by step questions but a general task, as to see how the participants will individually tackle them. Once they have completed our general instructions, we will ask various questions about the difficulty of performing the task, if it was confusing and which task is the hardest.  </p>

  <h3 class="title">Usability Test Scenario </h3>
  <p>This usability test is to test out how easy it is to perform tasks an average University student at AUT would use. There will be several different tasks that are each unique and different. The scenario is performing simple tasks to being ready to make a written report with a group. </p>

  <p> 1. Send a message to Nathan Flanagan or Masaomi using Canvas in the Byzantine group </p>
  <p> 2. Create a to-do list task for the HCI class; and view it once it's made in the calendar  </p>
  <p> 3. Go to the library in Canvas and find the referencing section for APA 7th edition referencing </p>
  <p> 4. Using Canvas, find the lab space booking website  </p>

  <h3 class="title">Interview questions</h3>
  <p> For our questions, we had questions talking about which task was the hardest and the easiest, asking them on a scale of 1-5, 1 being easy and 5 being hard on each tasks difficulty, their overall satisfaction with Canvas, how they would improve Canvas if they could and if they have a negative or positive experience with Canvas and why. These questions will help us gain further insight into what our participants are thinking, and find if theres any particular areas of Canvas that's difficult to navigate and if the participants share the same difficulties, why its difficult for each participant and the different areas.
