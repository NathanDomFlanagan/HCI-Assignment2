  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>The internet has become an essential infrastructure for us. Many people use mobile phones or pc to communicate with other people, work, and even take online lectures. Many schools and colleges adopt learning management systems that elevate the learning experience of students. AUT has been using Blackboard and replaced it with AUT Canvas recently. AUT Canvas is a web-based learning management system. Canvas provides many functionalities such as displaying the papers information that students are taking, submitting assignments, and checking schedules on a calendar. In this report, we conduct usability research on AUT Canvas. To begin with, we discuss what usability testing is and the methodology of usability testing. Secondly, we show the design of our usability research. Then, we present the collected data and our data analysis on it. Finally, we summarise our research and insights on the usability of AUT Canvas.</p>

  <h3>What is Usability and Usability testing</h3>

  <p>The International Standards Organization (ISO 9241-11) stated that usability can be measured by the user’s effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use. Also, this organization explained that usability is a concept that is relevant to ease of use or user-friendliness. For instance, a system can be user-friendly if a user can complete tasks on that system with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. To be more specific, effectiveness is whether users can achieve their goals and how high the degree of accuracy of it is. Efficiency is the resources such as time, effort, and materials that users use to complete their goals. Satisfaction is the user's physical, cognitive and emotional responses to the outcome of a system. In terms of usability testing, it has several aspects. Blakiston (2014) stated that usability testing is a method to get feedback on a product or a service from user’s interactions with it. Barnum (2010) mentioned that in usability testing. Rubin and Chisnell (2008) also argued that usability testing is a tool for making design decisions based on data collected from users. He pointed out that it helps companies to reduce users’ frustration with their products.</p>

  <h3>What is the exploratory research</h3>

  <p>The exploratory usability evaluation is the usability testing that asks users to complete simple instructions or walk through a system (Burnstein, 2016). In addition, this author mentioned that this type of usability testing is usually conducted in the early stages of development. Thorngate and Hoden (2017) reported that exploratory usability testing is conducted as a one-on-one session. The purpose of this test is to get the user’s intuitive understanding of the interface design (Rubin & Chisnell, 2008). Thus, test moderators can get insights into how users interact with a product and which design users are confused about. On the other hand, there is another usability testing called comparison testing, which literary compares two or more interface designs of a system (Burnstein, 2016).</p>

  <h3>What is observation</h3>

  <p>We focus on observation for our usability study because this is an important methodology of exploratory usability testing. In observation, test moderators watch and take videos of how participants interact with a product with their permission (Goodman et al., 2012). Then, the moderators can conduct interviews about the observation experience. We can observe what mistakes participants make, what actions make participants confused, and what participants found easy to use. The findings can give us insights into the interface of AUT Canvas.</p>
