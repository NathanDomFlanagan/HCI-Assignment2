            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            I have never worked on a research project before, coming up with a case study and then going out to the field to do the research, it was a refreshing and challenging project. Though we were slow to get started, we eventually came together and figured things out. In the end I felt a sense of accomplishment and joy to the process that I had don’t often get from other projects. At some point I eventually realised why doing usability research is important for a product. It was genuinely insightful to see how the participants undertake the test and how each one of their actions and thoughts process were different from one another.

         <h5>Initial impression</h5>
          <p>
            My assumption at first was that everyone would have the same experience using Canvas as we all have used it before, but it was not the case. Each person had their own way of exploration and going about doing the tasks. Each one of them had things that they find difficult and things that they find easy. I realised that my head was filled with assumptions and didn’t see why a usability test was significant at first but going through an actual live experiment that I learnt that it is very important.
