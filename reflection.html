            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            I have never worked on a research project before, coming up with a case study and then going out to the field to do the research, it was a refreshing and challenging project. Though we were slow to get started, we eventually came together and figured things out. In the end I felt a sense of accomplishment and joy to the process that I had donâ€™t often get from other projects. At some point I eventually realised why doing usability research is important for a product. It was genuinely insightful to see how the participants undertake the test and how each one of their actions and thoughts process were different from one another.

         <h5>Initial impression</h5>
          <p>
            My assumption at first was that everyone would have the same experience using Canvas as we all have used it before, but it was not the case. Each person had their own way of exploration and going about doing the tasks. Each one of them had things that they find difficult and things that they find easy. I realised that my head was filled with assumptions and didn't see why a usability test was significant at first but going through an actual live experiment I learnt that it is very important. 
          </p>
          <h5>What went wrong</h5>
          <p>Finding the participants and trying to organise a time that works for everyone was the hardest task. We could not get all the participants we wanted to test to come in the end. We were planning for 12 people but only ended up with 7, but one of participant data we could not use. There was a mistake by us and the participant did the exploration different compared to all other participants. Another problem that I did not realised would be a problem was finding a screenrecording. All the ones we tried gave us limited amount of time or trial before forcing a paying fee. It took a long time to get setup when starting the testing phrase and we made the participants wait. We did not anticipate a lot of these issues before hand and so one of the participant had to leave before they even had the chance to do their test.</p>

            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            i wasn't quite sure how to approach this paper. I haven't done a usability test before, nor have I ever had to interview people in a formal type of way to get meaningful results so I was wondering during the earlier weeks on how to attempt to begin the process of conducting a usability test. When our group started conducting the testing it was quite fun, I assumed that it would have been more of a hassle to have to individually assess our participants in our usability test, but it was a fun experience and process and I would not mind doing another usability test in the future. I learnt the value of the testing and the process as our data we collected was very meaningful.
          </p>
          <h5>Initial impression</h5>
            <p>
            Going into our first participant I already had an idea of the certain areas of "problem" in Canvas and I assumed all our participants would have the same outcomes, but I was wrong.
