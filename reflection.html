          <h5>Introduction</h5>
          <p>
            I have never worked on a research project before, coming up with a case study and then going out to the field to do the research, it was a refreshing and challenging project. Though we were slow to get started, we eventually came together and figured things out. In the end I felt a sense of accomplishment and joy to the process that I had donâ€™t often get from other projects. At some point I eventually realised why doing usability research is important for a product. It was genuinely insightful to see how the participants undertake the test and how each one of their actions and thoughts process were different from one another. 
          </p>
         <h5>Initial impression</h5>
          <p>
            My assumption at first was that everyone would have the same experience using Canvas as we all have used it before, but it was not the case. Each person had their own way of exploration and going about doing the tasks. Each one of them had things that they find difficult and things that they find easy. I realised that my head was filled with assumptions and didn't see why a usability test was significant at first but going through an actual live experiment I learnt that it is very important. 
          </p>
          <h5>What went wrong</h5>
          <p>Finding the participants and trying to organise a time that works for everyone was the hardest task. We could not get all the participants we wanted to come in the end. We were planning for 12 people but only ended up with 7, but one of participant data we could not use. There was a mistake by us and the participant did the exploration different compared to all other participants. Another problem that I did not realised was finding a screen recording. All the ones we tried gave us limited amount of time or trial before forcing a paying fee. It took a long time to get setup when starting the testing phrase and we made the participants wait. We did not anticipate a lot of these issues before hand and so one of the participant had to leave before they even had the chance to do their test.</p>
          <h5>What to do next time</h5>
          <p>Now that I have experience doing this research paper, I think I will have a much better understanding of how to go about doing it from the very start, wasting less time and will be much more organise throughout the process. I will be able to have gears, applications and equipments ready for participants and will do testing with the group beforehand making sure everything is perfect not wasting the participant time. Another lesson I learnt is to start the testing phrase as early as possible. If any participants decide to drop out all of a sudden, then there will be time to search for another.</p>
          <h5>Conclusion</h5>
          <p>Starting out is always hard, but keeping at it, asking for help and talking to each other is the best thing to do. This is something I've picked up througout HCI and especially during this project. I was very intimiated by the project at first, there was many new things to learn and I got lost. But now I've gone through it, I have gained confident and knowledge I can carry to other area of my course and life. I can see myself applying many lessons learnt throughout HCI to things I will be creating and designing in the future.</p>

          <h5>Introduction</h5>
          <p>   
            i wasn't quite sure how to approach this paper. I haven't done a usability test before, nor have I ever had to interview people in a formal type of way to get meaningful results so I was wondering during the earlier weeks on how to attempt to begin the process of conducting a usability test. When our group started conducting the testing it was quite fun, I assumed that it would have been more of a hassle to have to individually assess our participants in our usability test, but it was a fun experience and process and I would not mind doing another usability test in the future. I learnt the value of the testing and the process as our data we collected was very meaningful.
          </p>
          <h5>Initial impression</h5>
            <p>
            Going into our first participant I already had an idea of the certain areas of "problem" in Canvas and I assumed all our participants would have the same outcomes, but I was wrong. Each participant not only had their own way of comepleting their given tasks, but they also found different tasks more hard or more easier than each other. This is probably because of their backgrounds and all studying different degrees so I didn't take into account that some people have never even considered that you could perform the tasks we gave them.
            </p>
          <h5>What went wrong</h5>
            <p>Finding participants was difficult as our test was on the usability of the Canvas website, therefor we needed our participants to be students that have used and have experience using the website frequently for their studies. This was a problem as we had to either try and get random strangers to do our test, probably by giving a reward for participating, or inviting our friends or people we know to volunteer for us. Another problem we encountered was our primary way of recording. We used a screen recorder app that also recorded audio from our participants, but the recording apps had problems as the free version had limited recording time, or functions and this made data collection difficult. Due to this problem we took a lot of time setting up and this led to us finishing a lot later than planned initially.
            </p>
          <h5>What to do next time</h5>
            <p>With my new gained knowledge from doing my first Usability Test I have learnt a lot of things and have understood how to makemyself more prepared if I were to do another Usability Test in the future. Firstly for our participants I would search for participants a lot earlier than what we had done, this is to ensure we have participants to test with for our data collections. As for our tools we used to record, mainly our screen recorder software I would probably look into researching the best software for my needs in screen recording that is both free and easy to use with no problems like in time limit. Minimising these problems will lead to greater success and less loss of time and energy spent working around the problems we encountered.
            </p>
          <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            <p>In conclusion, since this was not just my first time, but also my groups first time conducting a research project like this, we made a lot of mistakes but in return also gained valuable knowledge we can use for another resarch project like this to prevent these mistakes again. The skills learnt from making mistakes will help me in my academic journey and the HCI skills I learnt will also help.
