            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>I had a lot of difficulties with this project. For example, none of us had ideas for software or devices on that we would conduct usability testing. Thus, we spent a week searching for something that could be our topic. It turned out that many people complained about the useability of AUT Canvas. I think using Canvas for this test was a good choice as it was a relatively new system to AUT students. Also, we were not familiar with testing methods. Thus, it was a bit tough to decide which testing method we were going to use.  Even though I encountered many problems, I am happy with this project since all of us worked hard and could overcome all the difficulties and finish this project. </p>
            <h5>Initial impression</h5>
            <p>I assumed that most of the participants have a negative impression on Canvas because I heard many AUT people, even lecturers, have problems with Canvas. However, we found that there were participants who had a positive impression. I realized more samples will cover more diverse evaluations because each person has his/her own expectations from a system. This experience made me realize the importance of usability testing.</p>
            <h5>What I learnt</h5>
            <p>I learned a lot of things about HCI in this paper such as human senses that we use when we interact with an object, usability testing methods, and user experience. Especially, it was intriguing that there are many ways to discover users’ confusion and satisfaction with systems. I understood the difference between some testing methods, such as experiments which have independent and control variables and observations which approach how users interact with systems, and surveys which gauge user experience. Furthermore, I learned how to measure usability. There are some components of usability such as ease of use, ease of learning, error recovery, and user satisfaction. Throughout this project, I gained confidence in my knowledge of usability. I also understand it is important to learn recording tools beforehand. This is because we had problems with our recording tools when we conducted our usability testing. </p>
            <h5>What to do next time</h5>
            <p>If I had a chance of conducting usability testing again, I would like to have more conversations with participants. I am sure this is one of the ways to express participants’ emotions. Also, I would try to record participants' faces and bodies so that I know how they take a test. This is because I found that our bodies tell a lot of information. For instance, some of our participants seemed nervous during the testing. There were some participants who slightly shook their legs, or sighed. I would need to analyse if these kinds of reactions came from the system or nervousness about the test. In addition, I would like to have more participants if I had this kind of testing. The more samples I have, the more accurate my inference of the population will be.</p>
            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            <p>To sum up, I am glad that I took this paper. I could learn about usability that I have been interested in. Even though the first six weeks confused me a bit, most of the study materials were enjoyable. After completing this project, I feel more confident in UI/UX field. I am sure I would not be afraid of conducting usability testing in the future if I had a chance. </p>

          <h5>Introduction</h5>
          <p>
            I have never worked on a research project before, coming up with a case study and then going out to the field to do the research, it was a refreshing and challenging project. Though we were slow to get started, we eventually came together and figured things out. In the end I felt a sense of accomplishment and joy to the process that I had don’t often get from other projects. At some point I eventually realised why doing usability research is important for a product. It was genuinely insightful to see how the participants undertake the test and how each one of their actions and thoughts process were different from one another.
          </p>
         <h5>Initial impression</h5>
          <p>
            My assumption at first was that everyone would have the same experience using Canvas as we all have used it before, but it was not the case. Each person had their own way of exploration and going about doing the tasks. Each one of them had things that they find difficult and things that they find easy. I realised that my head was filled with assumptions and didn't see why a usability test was significant at first but going through an actual live experiment I learnt that it is very important.
          </p>
          <h5>What went wrong</h5>
          <p>Finding the participants and trying to organise a time that works for everyone was the hardest task. We could not get all the participants we wanted to come in the end. We were planning for 12 people but only ended up with 7, but one of participant data we could not use. There was a mistake by us and the participant did the exploration different compared to all other participants. Another problem that I did not realised was finding a screen recording. All the ones we tried gave us limited amount of time or trial before forcing a paying fee. It took a long time to get setup when starting the testing phrase and we made the participants wait. We did not anticipate a lot of these issues before hand and so one of the participant had to leave before they even had the chance to do their test.</p>
          <h5>What to do next time</h5>
          <p>Now that I have experience doing this research paper, I think I will have a much better understanding of how to go about doing it from the very start, wasting less time and will be much more organise throughout the process. I will be able to have gears, applications and equipments ready for participants and will do testing with the group beforehand making sure everything is perfect not wasting the participant time. Another lesson I learnt is to start the testing phrase as early as possible. If any participants decide to drop out all of a sudden, then there will be time to search for another.</p>
          <h5>Conclusion</h5>
          <p>Starting out is always hard, but keeping at it, asking for help and talking to each other is the best thing to do. This is something I've picked up througout HCI and especially during this project. I was very intimiated by the project at first, there was many new things to learn and I got lost. But now I've gone through it, I have gained confident and knowledge I can carry to other area of my course and life. I can see myself applying many lessons learnt throughout HCI to things I will be creating and designing in the future.</p>

          <h5>Introduction</h5>
          <p>
            i wasn't quite sure how to approach this paper. I haven't done a usability test before, nor have I ever had to interview people in a formal type of way to get meaningful results so I was wondering during the earlier weeks on how to attempt to begin the process of conducting a usability test. When our group started conducting the testing it was quite fun, I assumed that it would have been more of a hassle to have to individually assess our participants in our usability test, but it was a fun experience and process and I would not mind doing another usability test in the future. I learnt the value of the testing and the process as our data we collected was very meaningful.
          </p>
          <h5>Initial impression</h5>
            <p>
            Going into our first participant I already had an idea of the certain areas of "problem" in Canvas and I assumed all our participants would have the same outcomes, but I was wrong. Each participant not only had their own way of comepleting their given tasks, but they also found different tasks more hard or more easier than each other. This is probably because of their backgrounds and all studying different degrees so I didn't take into account that some people have never even considered that you could perform the tasks we gave them.
            </p>
          <h5>What went wrong</h5>
            <p>Finding participants was difficult as our test was on the usability of the Canvas website, therefor we needed our participants to be students that have used and have experience using the website frequently for their studies. This was a problem as we had to either try and get random strangers to do our test, probably by giving a reward for participating, or inviting our friends or people we know to volunteer for us. Another problem we encountered was our primary way of recording. We used a screen recorder app that also recorded audio from our participants, but the recording apps had problems as the free version had limited recording time, or functions and this made data collection difficult. Due to this problem we took a lot of time setting up and this led to us finishing a lot later than planned initially.
            </p>
          <h5>What to do next time</h5>
            <p>With my new gained knowledge from doing my first Usability Test I have learnt a lot of things and have understood how to makemyself more prepared if I were to do another Usability Test in the future. Firstly for our participants I would search for participants a lot earlier than what we had done, this is to ensure we have participants to test with for our data collections. As for our tools we used to record, mainly our screen recorder software I would probably look into researching the best software for my needs in screen recording that is both free and easy to use with no problems like in time limit. Minimising these problems will lead to greater success and less loss of time and energy spent working around the problems we encountered.
            </p>
          <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            <p>In conclusion, since this was not just my first time, but also my groups first time conducting a research project like this, we made a lot of mistakes but in return also gained valuable knowledge we can use for another resarch project like this to prevent these mistakes again. The skills learnt from making mistakes will help me in my academic journey and the HCI skills I learnt will also help. Overall I enjoyed this experience with this class and working with my group mates was enjoyable so Im happy at the turnout of our work.
